This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

# prepare data
```{r}
celltype <- Idents(ctrl)
write.csv(celltype,"ctrl_celltype.csv")  # 将细胞名称的-替换为.，作为phenotype文件输入


celltype <- Idents(HSD)
write.csv(celltype,"HSD_celltype.csv") 

rawdata <- get_data_table(ctrl,highvar = F,type = "counts")
write.csv(rawdata,"ctrl_rawdata.csv")
```

# plot
```{r fig.width=4, fig.height= 3}
# 下载Cytotrace结果文件
cyto_res <- read.csv("./ctrl_only/CytoTRACE_results.txt",sep = '\t')

ctrl$cytotrace <- cyto_res$CytoTRACE

f("cytotrace", ctrl, cols = c("deeppink", "#1E90FF"))
```
```{r fig.width=4, fig.height= 3}
# 下载Cytotrace结果文件
cyto_res <- read.csv("./HSD_only/cytotrace/CytoTRACE_results.txt",sep = '\t')

HSD$cytotrace <- cyto_res$CytoTRACE

f("cytotrace", HSD, cols = c("deeppink", "#1E90FF"))
```
Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
